# Roadmap Ideas

Ideas and planned features for mouse-mcp.

## MCP 2025-11-25 Spec Compliance

Current SDK: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.24.3` (supports 2025-11-25 protocol)

### Gap Analysis

| Tools | ✅ Implemented | 6 tools with schemas |
| Resources | ❌ Missing | Could expose disney:// URIs |
| Prompts | ✅ Implemented | 3 trip planning templates (park-day, dining-scout, thrill-finder) |
| Tasks | ⏸️ Deferred | Experimental API, requires McpServer high-level API |
| Sampling | ❌ N/A | Server-to-client, not needed |
| Elicitation | ❌ Missing | Could request park preferences |
| Roots | ❌ N/A | Filesystem boundaries, not applicable |
| OAuth 2.1 Auth | ✅ Implemented | Full spec compliance with PKCE, DPoP, JWKS rotation |
| .well-known Discovery | ✅ Implemented | Server metadata at /.well-known/mcp |
| Streamable HTTP | ✅ Implemented | HttpTransportServer with /mcp endpoint |
